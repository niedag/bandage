TODO:
Research other HuggingFaceEmbedings (for other compatible models)
- Current use: sentence-transformers/all-mpnet0base-v2
- Update packages to relevant standard
- Swap to Qwen?

Goal: 
- Create agentic AI system on HP AI Studio to provide predictive information about survival chances after certain treatments?
- Other considerations and topics: Patient care, medication, useful tool for patient or useful tool for doctors?
- Doubly robust estimation of causal effects

Important to discuss holes in research, application on certain platforms, challenges on other platforms.
Possibly use QWEN model as alternative
